# FileOrganiser
A File Organizer in Python sorts files in a directory based on their extensions (e.g., images, documents, audio). It creates folders for each type (if they donâ€™t exist) and moves files into their corresponding folders. The script uses Python libraries like os, shutil, and a mapping of file extensions to categories for organizing the files.
